# San Francisco Real Estate Market - Rental Properties - 2010-2016
6th weekly challenge, focused on data visualization and finding viable investment opportunities in the San Francisco housing market by studying the growth of rental income compare to avg sale price per square foot for each neighborhood.

The analysis found that gross rental income has far outpaced sale prices per square foot since 2010 in almost all neighborhoods. 


San Francisco seems to be a great market for a one-click, buy-and-rent strategy because rental incomes continue to grow at a much faster pace than the cost to purchase properties. When honing in on neighborhoods, one should look for the best (highest) ratio when it comes to gross rental income compared to sale price per square foot. Put another way, it's best to look for high rental income and a low price per square foot.

Areas like Silver Terrace, Hunters Point, the Outer Mission, Visitacion Valley, and Bayview all seem to be attractive areas where rental income is growing while avg sale price per square foot remains relatively low.
